# Azure Startup Templates Repository

Welcome to a curated collection of ARM and Bicep templates designed to help startups quickly and securely get started on Microsoft Azure.

## Purpose
This repository provides ready-to-deploy infrastructure templates for common startup scenarios, including networking, security, and foundational cloud resources. Each template is crafted to:
- Accelerate cloud adoption for startups
- Reduce misconfiguration risks
- Promote best practices from day one

## Well-Architected Framework (WAF) Alignment
All templates in this repo are built to align with the Azure Well-Architected Framework:
- **Reliability:** Resources are named and tagged for easy management and automation.
- **Security:** Default configurations minimize exposure and enforce least privilege.
- **Cost Optimization:** Templates are lean, focusing on essential resources to keep costs predictable.
- **Operational Excellence:** Tagging and modular design support automation and resource tracking.
- **Performance Efficiency:** Scalable address spaces and resource definitions support future growth.

## Zero Trust Principles
Security is foundational. These templates:
- Deny public access by default
- Use restrictive network security rules
- Require explicit configuration for any external exposure
- Leverage tagging for identity, access management, and automation

## How to Use
Browse the folders for different templates. Each folder contains:
- A Bicep or ARM template
- A README explaining the scenario and deployment steps
- A Deploy to Azure button (where applicable) for one-click deployment

## Why This Matters
Startups need secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud foundations. By using these templates, you:
- Avoid common security pitfalls
- Build on proven architectural patterns
- Save time and focus on your core business
